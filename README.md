Our purposes on this project are:

1- Reproduce the results of Learning to See in the Dark project, as can be seen here:

2- Obtain results faster via optimization of the code.

3- Trying to have better results with modifications. (optional goal)

4- Testing different architectures on this problem. (optional goal)
